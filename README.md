![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b443cec-b07d-40f3-8a65-eea90ed15219)

## This project focuses on designing a comprehensive network infrastructure for the University of Transport and Communications (UTH) campus buildings. The goal is to provide a scalable, secure, and efficient network that meets the needs of students, faculty, and administrative staff across multiple campus locations.

## Project Overview
- Objective: To develop a detailed network design that supports reliable connectivity, high performance, and secure data transmission for all campus users.

- Scope: The design includes core routers, switches (core and access layers), firewalls, wireless access points, DHCP servers, and cabling infrastructure for multiple buildings within the UTH campus.

## Features:

- VLAN segmentation for different departments and user groups.

- Redundant paths to ensure network availability.

- Centralized management of IP address allocation via DHCP.

- Integration of security measures including firewall rules and access control.

- Wireless network coverage optimized for student and faculty areas.

## Technologies and Tools
- Network topology design tools (e.g., Cisco Packet Tracer, GNS3)

- IP addressing and subnetting schemes

- Routing protocols (e.g., OSPF, EIGRP)

- Network security principles

- Documentation using diagrams and configuration scripts

## Expected Outcomes
- A scalable network design capable of handling current and future user demand.

- Enhanced network security to protect sensitive university data.

- Efficient resource allocation and network management.

- Improved user experience through reliable wired and wireless connectivity.

## Conclusion
- The network design for all three UTH campuses unifies B√¨nh Th·∫°nh (Campus 1), Th·ªß ƒê·ª©c (Campus 2), and District 12 (Campus 3) under a single, secure, and highly available architecture. By segmenting traffic with VLANs, providing dual-path redundancy from the core to each access layer, and automating IP assignment through centralized DHCP, the design balances today‚Äôs teaching-and-research workloads with tomorrow‚Äôs growth. Firewall rule-sets and access-control lists harden the edge, while campus-wide Wi-Fi roaming ensures a seamless experience for students and faculty as they move between classrooms, laboratories, and common areas.

- Implementing this blueprint will give UTH a scalable foundation that is easy to monitor, troubleshoot, and expand‚Äîfreeing the IT team to focus on innovation rather than firefighting. With the physical layer laid out, logical topologies validated in simulation, and clear documentation for every building, the university is ready to transition from design to deployment‚Äîand deliver reliable connectivity that powers learning and research for years to come.
